Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Xiaoran Tu & Xiangyu Peng. I got to understand the instructions of this assignment better.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Thursday evening. I got some debugging help.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think it's not easy and as consice as Python, but I do like its feature that it uses a complier instead of an interpreter, which makes programming more effective.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Java is very similar to Python but also very different. They are similar because I feel like they share the coding logic and my previous Python experience helps me understand what to do. They are different becase Java involves new grammar. My conclusion is that programming in general really tests our ability to construct the logic. Different languages are just different tools.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I really find developing the chatbox in three stages make it a lot easier. By starting with a smaller goal, I can make a simple functioning chatbot first without suffering too much. And then I have the motivation of making it better and I developed more features for it. My advide would be the 4s: Start small, slow and simple.
