- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think it's not easy and as consice as Python, but I do like its feature that it uses a complier instead of an interpreter, which makes programming more effective.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Java is very similar to Python but also very different. They are similar because I feel like they share the coding logic and my previous Python experience helps me understand what to do. They are different becase Java involves new grammar. My conclusion is that programming in general really tests our ability to construct the logic. Different languages are just different tools.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I just finished my first version of the Chatbot and it worked as expected. I'm going to update it and add more features. My advide would be don't be afraid to fail and try your best.
